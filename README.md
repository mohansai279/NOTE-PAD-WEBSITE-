# Note Taking Website

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a simple note-taking web application. The primary file, `note.html`, provides a user interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes. The notes are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to retain their notes even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Features
- **Add Notes**: Users can add new notes by clicking the "Add Note" button.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can type directly into the text areas to edit their notes. Changes are saved automatically.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete notes by clicking the delete button (âœ–) located at the top-right corner of each note.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
